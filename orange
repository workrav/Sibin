In this program, we have used a while loop to print all the Fibonacci numbers up to n.

If n is not part of the Fibonacci sequence, we print the sequence up to the number that is closest to (and lesser than) n.

Suppose n = 100. First, we print the first two terms t1 = 0 and t2 = 1.

Then the while loop prints the rest of the sequence using the nextTerm variable:
